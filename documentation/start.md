# Joomla! Development & Learning

Joomla! Development & Learning is a **complete** Development and learning environment (not just) for Joomla!. It is based on open source software, starting with the operating system.

It can be installed as a virtual machine and act as a local development build server.

User documentation is written using the [[MarkdownGitWiki]](MarkdownGitWiki) extension - waiting for your contribution.

A new interactive learning system based on automated system task will "show you" how to **do** the job.

The required previous knowledge level ranges from "rookie" to "lead developer".
